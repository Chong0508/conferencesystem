## Abstract (in 300 words)
  ## 1. Background ##
This project focuses on the development of a full-stack Conference Management System (CMS) inspired by the EasyChair platform, which is widely used for managing academic conferences. As conferences grow in scale and complexity, managing submissions, reviews, and communication manually becomes inefficient and error-prone. To address these challenges, the project integrates Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend to create a dynamic, responsive, and centralized web application. The system aims to support essential conference management activities while demonstrating modern web development practices.

   ## 2. Problem Statement (from article) ##
Conference organizers often face difficulties in handling large numbers of paper submissions, assigning suitable reviewers, tracking review progress, and maintaining transparent communication among stakeholders. Without a unified system, these processes can become fragmented, leading to delays, conflicts of interest, and administrative inefficiencies. Inspired by the EasyChair conference management model, this project addresses the need for a stable, reusable, and scalable web-based system that can effectively manage conference workflows through well-structured components and APIs.

  ## 3. Main objective ##
The main objective of this project is to design and develop a Conference Management System using Angular and Spring Boot that supports core conference operations such as submission management, reviewer assignment, and CRUD-based data handling. The project also aims to provide hands-on experience with full-stack development, API integration, version control using Git and GitHub, containerization with Docker, and cloud deployment following industry standards.

  ## 4. Methodology  ##
The project follows a structured development approach where Angular is used to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with modular components and routing. Spring Boot is employed to develop RESTful APIs that manage business logic and database operations. MySQL is used as the relational database for data persistence. Bootstrap is applied for responsive UI design. The entire system is containerized using Docker, and Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the frontend, backend, and database services for consistent deployment across environments.

  ## 5. Result ##
The final outcome is a fully functional full-stack conference management web application. The Angular frontend provides an interactive user interface, while the Spring Boot backend efficiently handles data processing and API requests. CRUD operations are successfully implemented, and the system is deployed using Docker containers. The application is hosted on a cloud platform and version-controlled using GitHub, demonstrating seamless integration of all system components.

 ## 6. Conclusion ##
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the successful implementation of a modern Conference Management System inspired by EasyChair. By integrating Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker, the system offers a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution for managing academic conferences. The project also enhances practical skills in full-stack development, DevOps practices, and cloud deployment, reflecting real-world software development workflows.
